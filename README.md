Structral Equation Modelling for Digital Soil Mapping 
=======

This repository contain the code of my [PhD thesis](http://library.wur.nl/WebQuery/wda/2235514)

We recently obtained the award of **"Best paper in Pedometrics 2017"** for the paper: 

Angelini, M. E., Heuvelink, G. B. M., & Kempen, B. (2017). Multivariate mapping of soil with structural equation modelling. European Journal of Soil Science, 68(5), 575â€“591. https://doi.org/10.1111/ejss.12446

The R script of this paper can be seen **[here](https://github.com/angelini75/SEM2DSM/blob/master/Paper_2/SEM_1.0.R)** where you can find (not in a very elegant way) code of the SEM implementation, plots, validation and predictions.
